# Seminars 3 & 4 — Hedonometer (Project Folder)

This folder provides an **example project structure** (and an instructor/demo script) for the Seminars 3 & 4 group project using the **labMT 1.0** dataset (Data Set S1 from the Hedonometer paper).

It includes:
- the labMT 1.0 dataset file (`data/raw/Data_Set_S1.txt`)
- a runnable demo analysis script (`src/hedonometer_labmt_demo.py`) that produces a *typical* set of outputs aligned to the assignment
- course documents in `docs/` (original paper + paper companion + assignment + project quickstart), provided as **.pdf**

## Folder layout (course convention)

- `src/` — Python scripts you run
- `data/raw/` — input data (treat as read-only)
- `figures/` — PNG plots (embed these in your GitHub README)
- `tables/` — CSV tables/summaries (optional to embed, but useful for analysis)
- `docs/` — assignment + paper companion + quickstart handout

## Setup + run (from the project root)

### 1) Create a virtual environment

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 2) Install dependencies
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) Run the demo analysis
```bash
python3 src/run_analysis.py
```

### What gets generated?
After running, look in:
- `figures/` — PNG plots
- `tables/` — CSV summary tables

Dataset provenance 
The labMT 1.0 dataset (“language assessment by Mechanical Turk”) was created  by Dodds et al. (2011) as part of their "hedonometer" work. The "hedonometer" is a tool that was designed to measure the average happiness of text collected from places like Twitter. The first thing the authors did was they selected 10,000 of the most frequently used English words and they were chosen based on how often they were used, not based on specialized words. Each word after that got rated by a few workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk on a scale from 1-9, 1 being very unhappy and 9 being very happy. Then they got these few ratings and calculated the average in order to produce a single happiness score by word. The standard deviation was then used to show the difference between the ratings. Then this word list was used to calculate the average happiness of collections of large texts by calculating an average happiness score where words that appear more often count more. In this way the dataset works as a word-based tool that measures how positive or negative large texts are. 

Critical reflection
 Through the labMT dataset it's possible to analyze big texts of emotional language but there are a few important things that decide what it can and cannot do. The happiness ratings were collected from Mechanical Turk workers which is a specific demographic and culture. That means that the scores are a reflection of understanding of emotion that’s not the same across the different cultures. Second, they were rated without context. Normally emotional meanings on words depend on tone, the context they were used at. The dataset simplifies emotional meaning. Third, the method uses a single numerical scale to measure a complex emotional expression. However, the design also makes the analysis easier in some ways. The dataset makes it possible for researchers to see general patterns in large positive or negative large texts, and also to compare across different texts and time periods. At the same time the limitation is that it’s difficult to capture deeper meaning, who is speaking, or how culture influences the language. Therefore, the labMT dataset is a useful but simplified measurement tool. It allows us to analyze emotional language in very large texts, but we need to question the assumptions it makes on language and emotion.

What our group did
In our own analysis we treated the labMT file as a tab-delimited dataset. We skipped the initial metadata lines, we converted the placeholder value “--” into missing values, and we converted the rank and happiness columns into real numbers so that we could calculate averages and create plots. We didn’t remove neutral words from the middle of the happiness scale. We analyzed the full distribution of happiness_average. We treated each word as having one fixed happiness score and also looked at how much raters opinions about words differentiated by using standard deviation. The missing rank values were interpreted as  “not in the top-5000 list for that corpus,” and we handled missing values differently depending on the task. These decisions affect the analysis of our results. We are describing patterns in the word list and how it appears across different text collections. We are not measuring the emotional tone of a specific text collection.
