# Seminars 3 & 4 — Hedonometer (Project Folder)

This folder provides an **example project structure** (and an instructor/demo script) for the Seminars 3 & 4 group project using the **labMT 1.0** dataset (Data Set S1 from the Hedonometer paper).

It includes:
- the labMT 1.0 dataset file (`data/raw/Data_Set_S1.txt`)
- a runnable demo analysis script (`src/hedonometer_labmt_demo.py`) that produces a *typical* set of outputs aligned to the assignment
- course documents in `docs/` (original paper + paper companion + assignment + project quickstart), provided as **.pdf**

## Folder layout (course convention)

- `src/` — Python scripts you run
- `data/raw/` — input data (treat as read-only)
- `figures/` — PNG plots (embed these in your GitHub README)
- `tables/` — CSV tables/summaries (optional to embed, but useful for analysis)
- `docs/` — assignment + paper companion + quickstart handout

## Setup + run (from the project root)

### 1) Create a virtual environment

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 2) Install dependencies
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) Run the demo analysis
```bash
python3 src/run_analysis.py
```

### What gets generated?
After running, look in:
- `figures/` — PNG plots
- `tables/` — CSV summary tables

## Dataset
We use the labMT 1.0 dataset (Dodds et al., 2011), which includes 10,222 English words rated for happiness.

Each word has:
- An average happiness score
- A standard deviation of ratings
- Frequency ranks in four corpora:
  - Twitter
  - Google Books
  - New York Times
  - Lyrics


## Data Cleaning

The dataset was loaded as a tab-delimited file using pandas. The first two metadata rows were skipped. Missing values marked as "--" were converted to NaN.

The final dataset contains 10,222 rows and 8 columns.

We confirmed that:
- No duplicate words are present.
- All happiness-related variables are numeric.
- Rank columns contain 5,222 missing values each, indicating words not present in the top 5000 most frequent words of the respective corpus.

A cleaned dataset was saved as `data/labmt_clean.csv`.

### Figures
We compare how “common language” differs across four corpora: Twitter, Google Books, the New York Times, and song lyrics. Each rank column in the labMT dataset contains exactly the top 5000 words for that corpus, so simply counting non-missing values yields 5000 words for each source. For this reason, meaningful differences between corpora are better understood by examining overlap rather than raw counts.

We find that only 2,881 words appear in both the Twitter and NYT top-5000 lists, and just 1,816 words appear in all four corpora. This indicates that what counts as “common” language varies substantially depending on where the language is observed.

As a concrete example, laughter appears in the Twitter top-5000 list but not in the NYT top-5000 list. This likely reflects differences in register and usage: Twitter language tends to include more informal and emotionally expressive vocabulary, whereas newspaper language favors a more formal style.
Figure X illustrates these corpus overlaps and highlights the uneven distribution of shared vocabulary across sources.
